SunCycle
========

Sublime Text 3 layout switch based on sunrise and sunset at your location.

![Sublime Text Console](http://smhg.github.io/sublime-suncycle/suncycle.png)

Some of Sublime Text's color schemes are at their best either during day or night.
This package lets you automatically switch between 2 color schemes (and optionally a theme) based on your local sunrise and sunset (which takes [DST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time) into account).

By default, an IP address lookup with [ip-api.com](https://ip-api.com) determines your location.

You can hardcode your coordinates in case you don't prefer an IP lookup or it fails.

## Installation
Install with [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/).

## Default preferences
```json
{
	"ipStackAccessKey": "",
    "day": {
        "color_scheme": "Packages/User/Solarized (Light) (SL).tmTheme",
        "theme": "Default.sublime-theme"
    },
    "night": {
        "color_scheme": "Packages/User/Solarized (Dark) (SL).tmTheme",
        "theme": "Default.sublime-theme"
    }
}
```
The optional `latitude` and `longitude` configuration properties allow you to specify a fixed location.
The optional `sunrise` and `sunset` configuration properties allow you to specify fixed sunrise/sunset times. (Coordinates are still used for determining the current timezone.)
